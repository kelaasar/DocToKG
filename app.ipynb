This directive defines the roles and responsibilities for managing and overseeing NASA’s nuclear\\nflight safety activities. It provides the requirements to implement NASA’s policy to protect the\\npublic, NASA workforce, high-value equipment and property, and the environment from potential\\nharm as a result of NASA activities and operations, by factoring safety as an integral feature of\\nprograms, projects, technologies, operations, and facilities.\\nb. This directive also describes NASA’s implementation of Federal requirements under National\\nSecurity Presidential Memorandum (NSPM)-20, “Presidential Memorandum on Launch of\\nSpacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019, radiological contingency\\nplanning (RCP) as a part of broader NASA emergency management activities (see NPD 8710.1 and\\nNPR 8715.2) and other factors, as well as agency-specific activities relating to ensuring safety and\\nmission success for NASA-sponsored payloads containing space nuclear systems (SNS) or other\\nradioactive material (note that these terms are defined in Appendix A).\\nc. This directive establishes a framework where other requirements, guidance, and processes (e.g.,\\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) nuclear safety and security requirements, U.S. Air and Space Force\\nrange safety requirements, NASA payload safety processes) relevant to nuclear flight safety can be\\nimplemented in to the overall Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) process.\\nP.2 Applicability\\na. This directive is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers, including Component\\nFacilities and Technical and Service Support Centers. This directive applies to the Jet Propulsion\\nLaboratory (a Federally-Funded Research and Development Center), other contractors, recipients of\\ngrants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the\\napplicable contracts, grants, or agreements.\\nb. This directive is applicable to activities involving flight of SNS or other radioactive material for\\nwhich NASA is the sponsoring agency or that involve the use of NASA personnel and assets for\\nphases of a flight where the SNS or other radioactive material has the potential to affect Earth’s\\nbiosphere. In some cases, aspects of the NASA nuclear flight safety program may fall under the\\nauspices of another Federal agency, such as in the case of a Federal Aviation Administration\\n(FAA)-issued license for the launch of NASA-provided radioactive material. If applicability of this\\ndirective is not clear, NASA personnel will consult with the Nuclear Flight Safety Officer (NFSO)\\nand the Office of the General Counsel to confirm responsibilities for nuclear flight safety.\\nc. This directive considers nuclear safety and radiological risk from both normal and off-normal\\nconditions during all phases of flight for which the SNS or other radioactive material has the\\npotential to affect Earth’s biosphere, typically starting with installation of the SNS or other\\nradioactive material into an integrated launch vehicle on Earth. Matters outside of this scope are\\ngenerally addressed by other NASA disciplines (e.g., planetary protection, crew safety).\\nd.

Overview\\n1.1 Introduction\\n1.1.1 This directive implements Federal requirements under NSPM-20, “Presidential Memorandum\\non Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019. NSPM-20\\nupdates the Federal process for the launch of SNS to “ensure a rigorous, risk informed safety\\nanalysis and launch authorization process.” This directive also incorporates NASA’s responsibilities\\nunder the authorities of other agencies involved in the launch of SNS or radioactive material, the\\nNational Response Framework, and the U.S.’s international commitments.\\n1.1.2 Procedures and levels of review and analysis required for nuclear launch and reentry\\nauthorization or concurrence vary with the quantity and form of material planned for use, as well as\\nwith the potential radiological risk (e.g., human health exposures, impacts on land use, or impacts on\\nproperty use). In the context of this document, reentry or planned return to Earth refers to intended\\nportions of the spaceflight and is addressed in the authorization or concurrence process. By contrast,\\nunplanned reentry (referring to an unintended event) is addressed in the safety analysis and RCP\\nprocesses.\\n1.2 Delegation of Responsibilities\\n1.2.1 Unless specifically prohibited, responsibilities and requirements may be delegated. The stated\\nrole or actor remains accountable for its implementation and outcome.\\n1.2.2 Where an office or organization is stated as the actor of a requirement, the Official in Charge\\nof that office or organization is responsible and accountable for the action and its outcome.\\n1.3 General Terms\\nDefinitions for general terms, such as “A2 mission multiple” and “space nuclear system” are\\nprovided in Appendix A.\\n1.4 Request for Relief\\n1.4.1 For additional information on the defined process for requesting and granting relief from\\nrequirements within this directive and standards incorporated by reference herein, see NPR 8715.3.\\nThe Chief, SMA is the Approving Authority for requests for relief to the requirements in this\\ndirective.\\n1.4.2 For NASA missions, non-conformances with Federal nuclear launch authorization direction in\\nNSPM-20 or other applicable regulatory-agency requirements will be elevated to the Administrator.\\nThe Administrator, Chief, SMA, and Chief Health and Medical Officer (CHMO) would make such\\ndeterminations in consideration of applicable National Space Policy and the responsibilities defined\\nin NPD 8700.1 with regards to consent to human safety and property risk on behalf of the general\\npublic.\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- Chapter1 incorporated into a contract.

Mission Categorization for the\\nPurposes of Nuclear Flight Safety\\n3.1 Space Nuclear System Tiering\\n3.1.1 For all missions that include an SNS, the MDAA shall notify the NFSO before System\\nDefinition Review (SDR)/Mission Definition Review (MDR) of the forthcoming launch or reentry\\nrequest to support planning of nuclear safety analysis and review activities, as outlined in Chapter 4.\\n.\\n3.1.2 For missions involving SNS, the MDAA shall determine the mission’s tier (with an associated\\ntechnical basis) and obtain Chief, SMA concurrence to inform the graded approach outlined in\\nChapter 4 of this directive and to ensure conformance with NSPM-20. Appendix C provides\\ninformation on NSPM-20 tiers. The NFSO will evaluate each tier determination to inform the Chief,\\nSMA’s concurrence.\\n3.1.3 For the aspects of mission tiering based on the quantity of material-at-risk, the MDAA (to be\\nthe MDAA with flight responsibilities if multiple MDAAs are contributing SNS or other radioactive\\nmaterial) should use the highest A2 mission multiple based on the quantity of radioactive materials\\nexpected:\\na. During pre-launch activities.\\nb. At launch.\\nc. Anytime the spacecraft will be in Earth orbit.\\nd. During any planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by).\\n3.1.4 The MDAA shall make a tier determination at up to 3 stages, as follows (the reasoning for\\nmultiple tiering determinations is discussed in Appendix C):\\na. Preliminary Tier Determination (PTD) – This determination is made immediately preceding Key\\nDecision Point C, as that life-cycle gate is defined in NPR 7120.5. This tiering determination will be\\nmade predominantly on the material-at-risk (A2 mission multiple – see Appendix D) and nuclear\\nfuel-type provisions (for fission reactor systems) contained in NSPM 20. Information related to the\\npotential radiation exposure levels and associated likelihoods from the safety analyses of relevant\\npast missions will also be considered. This determination serves to provide initial alignment and\\nclarity on whether a mission Safety Analysis Report (SAR) is required, whether the INSRB needs to\\nbe engaged, and who the likely authorizing official will be. This determination also serves to lock in\\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-issued A2 values applicable to the mission, given\\nthat these values are periodically updated. If the PTD concludes that a mission is not likely to meet\\nTier I, II, or III criteria, this marks the end of the tiering determination process (and all subsequent\\nnuclear flight safety processes described in this directive will be governed solely by the A2 mission\\nmultiple).\\nb.

Nuclear Flight Safety Requirements\\n4.1 Overview of Requirement Characterization\\nThe level of rigor required for nuclear safety analysis and review, the level of authority required to authorize\\nlaunch or reentry, the degree of interagency coordination warranted, the degree of RCP needed, and several\\nother relevant characteristics are all a function of the mission categorization described in the previous\\nchapter. This formulation provides a graded and risk-informed approach to supporting the decision-making\\nprocess. Table 1 provides a mapping of the various required characteristics for each of the differing possible\\ntiers and categories. This chapter provides the actual requirements associated with each unique element.\\nAppendix E provides a notional process flow for nuclear flight safety-related activities.\\n4.2 Nuclear Safety Analysis\\n4.2.1 The following requirements apply to the development of a nuclear safety analysis via either a mission\\nSAR or a Safety Analysis Summary (SAS), in accordance with Table 1. As discussed in the associated\\ndefinitions in Appendix A, the distinction between these two documents is the degree of rigor and\\nquantification. Additional contextual information is also provided in Appendix C.\\n4.2.1.1 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall compile the inputs required by the safety analysis\\npreparer (e.g., information about the launch vehicle and launch operations) in a timely manner to support\\nsafety analysis preparation, as well as ensuring any needed revisions are addressed as the mission progresses.\\n4.2.1.2 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall arrange for the preparation of the nuclear safety\\nanalysis (SAS or mission SAR) by the safety analysis preparer.\\n4.2.1.3 The NASA Program or Project Manager should ensure sufficient coordination between the NFSO,\\nthe INSRB (when applicable), the program, the launch vehicle inputs provider, and the safety analysis\\npreparer, including agreement to a schedule (typically to be developed prior to Key Decision Point C or its\\nequivalent) for the delivery of a mission SAR using a phased approach, with the complete final mission SAR\\nbeing delivered in accordance with the timeline listed in Table 1. Information potentially useful in the\\ngeneration of this schedule is provided in Appendix C and Appendix E.\\nTable 1.

The MDAA can always\\nrequest Agency Views of their own volition. In all other cases, the mission SAR and SER would be\\ntransmitted to the Head of the INSRB agencies (or their designee) as a courtesy, in parallel to proceeding\\nwith the launch authorization request.\\n4.4.2 Launch and reentry authorization or concurrence (as applicable) is obtained in accordance with the\\nauthorities and timelines indicated in Table 1, and outlined as follows:\\n4.4.2.1 For SNS in Tier III, the Administrator shall request and obtain the President’s authorization through\\nthe Director of the OSTP. Per NSPM 20, the Director of OSTP may authorize such launches, unless the\\nDirector of OSTP considers it advisable to forward the matter to the President for a decision. To support the\\nAdministrator’s request, a briefing by the applicable MDAA, the nuclear safety analysis preparer, and the\\nINSRB on the mission SAR, the SER, and the radiological contingency plans will be provided to the\\nAdministrator. If a Tier III mission included a planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), that would be part\\nof the mission profile addressed by the mission SAR, and thus covered by the launch authorization.\\n4.4.2.2 For SNS in Tier II, the MDAA shall request and obtain authorization from the NASA Administrator.\\nThe authorization request will include a briefing by the applicable MDAA, the nuclear safety analysis\\npreparer, and the INSRB on the mission SAR, the SER, and the radiological contingency plans.

If a Tier I mission included a planned\\nreturn to Earth (reentry or fly-by), that would be part of the mission profile addressed by the mission SAR,\\nand thus covered by the launch authorization.\\n4.4.2.4 For missions involving radioactive material, but not including an SNS, the MDAA, in consultation\\nwith the cognizant Center Radiation Safety Officer(s), shall request concurrence from the NFSO or Chief,\\nSMA (in accordance with Table 1), except where an Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)-issued\\ncategorical relief memo is being applied (in which case only a notification is required). This concurrence\\nrequest needs to account for radioactive material integrated into the spacecraft as part of mission design, as\\nwell as radioactive material that may be included in the launch or reentry (e.g., cargo). When the mission\\ninvolves planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), this will be included in the launch concurrence request\\nand will be covered by the launch concurrence. Appendix F provides a suggested format for the radioactive\\nmaterial reporting portion of the request.\\n4.4.2.5 For any planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by) of radioactive material not covered by a launch\\nconcurrence (such as return from an orbiting research platform) the NASA Program or Project Manager shall\\nrequest reentry concurrence in accordance with the analysis, review, and timelines identified in Table 1,\\nexcept when an OSMA-issued categorical relief memo is being applied (in which case only a notification is\\nrequired).\\n4.5 Contingency Planning and Coordination\\n4.5.1 For missions designated to require RCP in Table 1, the MDAA as the lead programmatic authority and\\nthe Center Director affiliated with the applicable range as the lead institutional authority, in coordination\\nwith the Chief, SMA and the NFSO, shall negotiate and implement a process to assure the safety of the\\npublic and NASA workforce in the event of a mishap that may create radiological risk, in cooperation with\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- Chapter4 incorporated into a contract.

This refers to a formal process of transmitting the mission SAR and SER to the Head\\nof an INSRB-participating organization and requesting any feedback that the Agency Head wishes\\nto be integrated into the launch authorization decision.\\nCategorical relief. A memorandum co-issued by the Chief, SMA and CHMO, which outlines\\nconditions where OSMA nuclear flight safety concurrence is not required owing to the small degree\\nof radiological risk of the mission relative to the assurance provided through NASA’s routine\\noversight of the handling of radioactive materials, and separately, of payload and range safety\\nactivities. When a launch or reentry meets these prescribed conditions, a waiver is not required for\\nany requirements in this directive that specifically states inapplicability upon the invocation of\\ncategorical relief (a.k.a., a blanket concurrence).\\nLaunch activities. The launch phase begins when the spacecraft transfers to internal power and ends\\nwhen the spacecraft achieves an operational configuration after separation from the launch vehicle.\\nMember of the public. This term is defined on an analysis-specific basis as follows: (i) primary\\nconsideration should be given to the distinction between public and non-public as it is codified for\\nthe applicable range; (ii) barring this, the codified policy of the applicable nuclear safety authority\\n(DOE or Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)) will be used.\\nNuclear safety. Application of safety policies, principles, and techniques to ensure the control and\\ncontainment of radioactive material to minimize adverse impacts from accidents that could endanger\\nlife or cause property damage. Assessing and managing radiological risk is an important component\\nof nuclear safety; however, nuclear safety also encompasses aspects (e.g., RCP, modeling\\nuncertainty) that may not be explicitly modeled in the radiological risk assessment.\\nPre-launch activities.

In the context of this directive, this term refers to the application of risk concepts\\n(see Risk) to assess the potential impacts of postulated accident scenarios that result in release of\\nradiological material. This assessment typically analyzes some combination of human health\\nexposures (via applicable exposure pathways), impacts on land use, and impacts on property use.\\nThese differing impacts are often inter-related (e.g., land interdiction assumptions may balance\\nimpacts on land use against the dose received through specific exposure pathways). The scope of\\nimpacts considered is typically proportional to the radiological risk.\\nRadiological Safety Review (RSR). A review of a planned launch or return to Earth (fly-by or\\nreentry) of radioactive material (sometimes evaluating a nuclear safety analysis and sometimes\\nserving as a stand-alone nuclear flight safety review) that qualitatively or semi-quantitatively\\naddresses the radiological risk of the mission, by describing the form and quantity of radioactive\\nmaterial being launched or reentered, describing the relevant mission profile, providing an analysis\\nof the probabilities of launch and in-flight accidents which could result in the terrestrial release of\\nradioactive materials (surface and air), providing a realistic and a pessimistically-biased estimate of\\nthe health and other effects due to a radioactive material release in the considered accident scenarios,\\nand providing mission-specific information that would be relevant for contingency planning and\\nmaterial recovery. The scope and depth of the RSR would be tailored and scaled to the risk, and\\nwould be less intensive than the effort needed to develop a SER.\\nRange safety. Application of safety policies, principles, and techniques to protect the public, NASA\\nworkforce, and/or property from hazards associated with range flight operations. Additionally, the\\nterm “Range Safety” is informally used to refer to the organization responsible for\\nimplementing/enforcing range safety requirements.\\nRisk. The consideration of (a) scenarios leading to undesired outcomes, (b) the likelihood of these\\nscenarios, and (c) the consequences, impact, or severity of the impact that would result if those\\nscenarios were to occur. Within a probabilistic risk assessment framework, a primary representation\\nof risk is the product of the likelihood of occurrence and the associated consequence, aggregated\\nacross all modeled scenarios. A separate representation of risk involves the tabulation of the\\nprobability of exceeding a given consequence at a specified value (or range of values) using a\\ncomplementary cumulative distribution function. In both uses, uncertainty is customarily treated.\\nSafety Analysis Report (SAR). The study of credible potential releases of radioactive material into\\nthe biosphere, often founded in a probabilistic risk assessment that: (a) uses launch vehicle accident\\nprobabilities and accident environment data as inputs to analysis tools that estimate the probabilities\\nand magnitudes of postulated radiological releases, (b) predicts transport through and deposition in\\nthe environment, (c) estimates accident impacts, and (d) evaluates the variability and uncertainty of\\nthe estimates, including gaps in knowledge (i.e., missing or incomplete information) that could\\nimpact the calculated estimates. Such a study may be system-specific (i.e., a system specific SAR)\\nor within the context of a mission (i.e., a mission SAR), As described in NSPM-20, a\\nsystem-specific SAR establishes a safety basis (a set of conditions under which safety analysis and\\nhazard controls provide assurance of safe operation). To leverage this system-specific SAR, the\\nmission SAR must either (i) demonstrate that the mission is within the safety basis envelope or (ii)\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- AppendixA incorporated into a contract.

Relative to a SAR, a SAS is typically not a probabilistic risk\\nassessment, but rather a quantitative screening analysis resulting in a conservatively-biased\\nassessment of the radiological risk of launching or reentering smaller sources. The SAS provides a\\ndescription of the radioactive materials, their physical state/chemical form, quantities involved,\\nmission profile information, the probabilities of potential launch vehicle and spacecraft failures, the\\nresulting accident impacts, and a characterization of the associated radiological risk.

This is clarifying information and does not contain any additional requirements.\\nC.1.1 NSPM-20 sets tier boundaries based on material-at-risk, technology, and radiological risk estimates\\nstemming from the nuclear safety analysis, with the ultimate tier depending on a combination of factors.\\nTherefore, final determinations are made after completion of the nuclear safety analysis. However, the\\ncharacteristics of safety analysis review depend on the tier, and so earlier evaluation of the likely tiering\\noutcome is also needed. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the NSPM-20 tiering criteria, while Table 2\\nprovides a tabular capturing of the same criteria.\\nFigure 1: Illustration Showing NSPM-20 Tiering Factors\\n(LWRHU = Light-weight radioisotope heater unit; MMRTG = Multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator; SAR = Safety Analysis\\nReport; SER = Safety Evaluation Report; SNS = Space nuclear system)\\nTable 2: NSPM-20 Tiering Criteria\\nTier Criteria for Space Nuclear Systems\\nTier - Quantity of radioactive material is = 1,000×A2 but = 100,000×A2\\nI\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- AppendixC incorporated into a contract.

In this directive, NSPM-20 is only applied to SNS (with the expectation that no other\\npayload would have an A2 mission multiple greater than 1,000), while the nuclear safety analysis would\\nneed to consider any additional radioactive material in the payload (in addition to the SNS). Other\\nrequirements in this directive ensure nuclear flight safety for all other missions.\\nC.1.2.2 While the term spacecraft is used in both NSPM-20 and this directive, any radioactive material on the\\nintegrated launch vehicle aside from the spacecraft would need to be considered (acknowledging that this\\nwould be atypical for a NASA mission).\\nC.1.2.3 The lower bound of Tier I is treated to equate to an A2 mission multiple of 1,000. This is effectively\\nthe lower end of historical SNS flown and comports with NSPM-20\\'s reporting requirement bounds codified\\nin Section 6 of that document.\\nC.1.2.4 There is a possibility that an SNS (that is not a fission reactor system) with an A2 mission multiple of\\nless than 1,000 could surpass the NSPM-20 Tier III criterion associated with the probability of an exposure\\nin excess of 25 rem being greater than 1 in 1 million. The tiering approach taken in this directive only\\naddresses this possibility to the extent that it can be reasonably foreseen at the Preliminary Tier\\nDetermination stage. Nevertheless, this is not a situation that is anticipated to occur in practice based on\\ncontemporary SNS designs, mission profiles, and radiological risk state-of-knowledge.\\nC.2 The following additional information is provided pertaining to nuclear flight safety, relative to the\\nrequirements contained in Chapter 4. . This is clarifying information and does not contain any additional\\nrequirements.\\nC.2.1 The following passages provide contextual information about safety analysis preparation practices.\\nC.2.1.1 While the details of the SAS or mission SAR schedule will be informed by other guidance, the\\nmutually agreed upon schedule would typically address: the planned analysis schedule; a technical interface\\ndocument between NASA and the safety analysis preparer; base assumptions, analysis limitations/bounds,\\nand model descriptions associated with the mission SAR or SAS development; and the development of a\\ndraft or initial mission SAR well in advance of (e.g., one year prior to) the final mission SAR. This, and\\nrelated information, can be captured in a Safety Design Strategy, Safety Architecture, Safety Case, or\\nequivalent product.\\nC.2.1.2 While the details of the SAS or mission SAR will be informed by other guidance, the scope of the\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- AppendixC incorporated into a contract.

The consideration of accident impacts would typically be sufficiently\\nbroad to support the nuclear safety review, the nuclear launch or reentry authorization or concurrence\\nprocess (comparison to NSPM-20\\'s safety guidelines, the specific items described in Section 5(b) of\\nNSPM-20, and mission tiering), range safety uses, mishap preparedness and contingency planning activities,\\nand public risk communications. The mission SAR or SAS would typically utilize a recognized standard or\\nprecedent (NRC or DOE guidance, INSRB guidance, a NASA Technical Standard, a consensus standard) or\\nan appropriate precedent (e.g., the mission SAR from a contemporary mission with a similar payload),\\nadjusted as necessary to address the specifics of the SNS context and the mission at-hand, for baselining the\\ncontents of the mission SAR.\\nC.2.1.3 The level of detail and content of the mission SAR or SAS will be commensurate with the mission\\nradiological risk. Per NSPM-20, \"a mission SAR may incorporate a system-specific SAR that establishes a\\nsafety basis for the space nuclear system,\" and NSPM-20 goes on to describe this relationship. In cases\\nwhere launch vehicles, configurations, mission characteristics, and SNS are similar and it is determined by\\nthe safety analysis and review stakeholders that a comparative analysis will appropriately estimate the\\nradiological risk of the mission, a comparative analysis can be utilized. Radioisotope heater unit (RHU) and\\nradioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) risk assessments have demonstrated over time that a fairly\\nmature understanding of mission phase radiological risk contributions exists for these devices, while also\\ndemonstrating shifts in the relative importance of phenomena associated with both changes to\\nstate-of-knowledge (e.g., breach modeling, dispersion modeling) and mission characteristics (e.g., clad\\ntemperature, launch window climatological conditions).\\nC.2.1.4 Where nuclear or radioactive materials are being provided from multiple sources, MDAAs may\\nprovide a single or multiple safety analysis document(s) to best meet this requirement (e.g., in a case where\\nan SNS relies heavily on an existing system-specific SAR while other radioactive material requires a\\ncompletely new SAS). Depending on the specifics of the circumstances, it may be necessary to justify why\\nthe radiological risks can be treated in an additive fashion when using multiple mission SARs. Some\\nconsequence metrics do not scale linearly with the activity of released material.\\nC.2.2 Regarding insurance and indemnification in the context of radiological incidents, in general, Federal\\nfunding is made available for resulting damages and response costs in accordance with Federal law through\\none or more of the Price-Anderson Act, the Space Act, and the Stafford Act. The final determination of\\nwhich of these, or other authorities, would be used to provide Federal funding in the event of a launch or\\nreentry accident can only be made after-the-fact, based on the specific facts of the actual incident and the\\nclaims in question.\\nC.2.3 Regarding SMA oversight following launch authorization, two approaches are suggested below for\\naccomplishing this best practice.\\nC.2.3.1 Alternative #1 - The NFSO, in coordination with the NASA Program or Project Manager, the\\nPayload Safety Working Group (PSWG) Chair, the Project-Level SMA TA, and the INSRB (when\\napplicable) can use the results of the nuclear safety analysis and nuclear safety review to construct a\\nnuclear-specific and mission-specific critical analysis assumptions list that would be formally issued to the\\nPSWG Chair and relevant SMA TAs, for use within the routine launch services and mission execution\\nprocesses. This list would, in effect, serve as an amendment to the NPR 8719.24 compliance matrix and\\nwould serve to facilitate the monitoring of anticipatable issues, if any are identified, that would cause the\\nmission to likely exceed (or further exceed by a significant amount) NSPM-20\\'s safety guidelines, or that\\nwould cause a significant degradation of defense-in-depth (e.g., fission product barriers). In this way, the list\\nserves as a tool to codify nuclear flight safety-specific factors into these stages of NASA\\'s routine risk\\nmanagement processes.\\nC.2.3.2 Alternative #2 - Barring adoption of the above, the NFSO could periodically monitor available\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- AppendixC incorporated into a contract.

In cases where identified events could reasonably be expected to cause the mission\\nexecution to exceed (or further exceed by a significant additional quantity) NSPM-20\\'s safety guidelines or\\nrequirements (e.g., Department of the Air Force risk constraint), the NFSO would perform a simple,\\nscoping-level qualitative or semi-quantitative assessment of the impact of the event or condition, and\\ndocument this assessment in a note to file. In cases where a specific event or condition is found to indeed\\nexceed (or further exceed by a significant additional quantity) the safety guidelines or a quantitative\\nrequirement, this would be captured in a memo and discussed with the relevant SMA interface, such that it\\ncan be factored in to safety and mission success activities (e.g., a PSWG Safety Review, the Safety and\\nMission Success Review (SMSR)).\\nC.2.3.2.1 Regarding Alternative #2, depending on the circumstances, the appropriate interface might be the\\nProject-level SMA TA, a Program-affiliated SMA TA, the SMA Launch Services Division Mission Safety\\nEngineer, the Payload Safety Program Executive, the Range Safety Program Executive, or the PSWG Chair.\\nIn some cases, the monitoring of information sources (e.g., the Launch Services Portal where the PSWG\\nposts spacecraft non-compliances after the Payload Safety Compliance has been signed) may be a suitable\\nreplacement to contacting the interface.\\nC.2.3.2.2 Also regarding Alternative #2, the appropriate periodicity of monitoring the mission will vary\\ngreatly depending on the phase of the mission execution (e.g., more frequently during the period following\\nSNS integration into the integrated launch vehicle and prior to launch versus less frequently during\\nspaceflight). Examples of events and conditions that would be relevant are: (a) a two-fold increase in the time\\nwindow in which the SNS is being cooled by ground support equipment relative to that assumed in the SAR,\\n(b) a significant deficiency identified in the performance of a safety-relief valve that cannot be mitigated and\\neffectively results in an increase in launch vehicle unreliability, and (c) a spacecraft malfunction while in\\nEarth orbit that significantly increases the likelihood of not being in a sufficiently high orbit when the\\nmission reaches end-of-life.\\nThis document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as\\nNPR 8715.26 -- AppendixC incorporated into a contract.

      "a. This directive defines the roles and responsibilities for managing and overseeing NASA’s nuclear\n",
      "flight safety activities. It provides the requirements to implement NASA’s policy to protect the\n",
      "public, NASA workforce, high-value equipment and property, and the environment from potential\n",
      "harm as a result of NASA activities and operations, by factoring safety as an integral feature of\n",
      "programs, projects, technologies, operations, and facilities.\n",
      "b. This directive also describes NASA’s implementation of Federal requirements under National\n",

      "radioactive material (note that these terms are defined in Appendix A).\n",
      "c. This directive establishes a framework where other requirements, guidance, and processes (e.g.,\n",
      "Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear safety and security requirements, U.S. Air and Space Force\n",
      "range safety requirements, NASA payload safety processes) relevant to nuclear flight safety can be\n",

      "P.1 Purpose\n",
      "a. This directive defines the roles and responsibilities for managing and overseeing NASA’s nuclear\n",
      "flight safety activities. It provides the requirements to implement NASA’s policy to protect the\n",
      "public, NASA workforce, high-value equipment and property, and the environment from potential\n",
      "harm as a result of NASA activities and operations, by factoring safety as an integral feature of\n",
      "programs, projects, technologies, operations, and facilities.\n",
      "b. This directive also describes NASA’s implementation of Federal requirements under National\n",
      "Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM)-20, “Presidential Memorandum on Launch of\n",
      "Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019, radiological contingency\n",

      "mission success for NASA-sponsored payloads containing space nuclear systems (SNS) or other\n",
      "radioactive material (note that these terms are defined in Appendix A).\n",
      "c. This directive establishes a framework where other requirements, guidance, and processes (e.g.,\n",
      "Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear safety and security requirements, U.S. Air and Space Force\n",
      "range safety requirements, NASA payload safety processes) relevant to nuclear flight safety can be\n",

      "directive is not clear, NASA personnel will consult with the Nuclear Flight Safety Officer (NFSO)\n",
      "and the Office of the General Counsel to confirm responsibilities for nuclear flight safety.\n",
      "c. This directive considers nuclear safety and radiological risk from both normal and off-normal\n",
      "conditions during all phases of flight for which the SNS or other radioactive material has the\n",
      "potential to affect Earth’s biosphere, typically starting with installation of the SNS or other\n",
      "radioactive material into an integrated launch vehicle on Earth. Matters outside of this scope are\n",
