Preface
P.1 Purpose
a. This directive defines the roles and responsibilities for managing and overseeing NASA’s nuclear
flight safety activities. It provides the requirements to implement NASA’s policy to protect the
public, NASA workforce, high-value equipment and property, and the environment from potential
harm as a result of NASA activities and operations, by factoring safety as an integral feature of
programs, projects, technologies, operations, and facilities.
b. This directive also describes NASA’s implementation of Federal requirements under National
Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM)-20, “Presidential Memorandum on Launch of
Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019, radiological contingency
planning (RCP) as a part of broader NASA emergency management activities (see NPD 8710.1 and
NPR 8715.2) and other factors, as well as agency-specific activities relating to ensuring safety and
mission success for NASA-sponsored payloads containing space nuclear systems (SNS) or other
radioactive material (note that these terms are defined in Appendix A).
c. This directive establishes a framework where other requirements, guidance, and processes (e.g.,
Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear safety and security requirements, U.S. Air and Space Force
range safety requirements, NASA payload safety processes) relevant to nuclear flight safety can be
implemented in to the overall Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) process.
P.2 Applicability
a. This directive is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers, including Component
Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers. This directive applies to the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (a Federally-Funded Research and Development Center), other contractors, recipients of
grants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the
applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.
b. This directive is applicable to activities involving flight of SNS or other radioactive material for
which NASA is the sponsoring agency or that involve the use of NASA personnel and assets for
phases of a flight where the SNS or other radioactive material has the potential to affect Earth’s
biosphere. In some cases, aspects of the NASA nuclear flight safety program may fall under the
auspices of another Federal agency, such as in the case of a Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA)-issued license for the launch of NASA-provided radioactive material. If applicability of this
directive is not clear, NASA personnel will consult with the Nuclear Flight Safety Officer (NFSO)
and the Office of the General Counsel to confirm responsibilities for nuclear flight safety.
c. This directive considers nuclear safety and radiological risk from both normal and off-normal
conditions during all phases of flight for which the SNS or other radioactive material has the
potential to affect Earth’s biosphere, typically starting with installation of the SNS or other
radioactive material into an integrated launch vehicle on Earth. Matters outside of this scope are
generally addressed by other NASA disciplines (e.g., planetary protection, crew safety).
d. This directive does not address procedures, requirements, or licensing details for using, storing,

shipping, or handling radioactive materials in ground processing facilities or activities, nor does it
cover these activities as they relate to preparation of the actual radioactive material for space use. For
additional information on these matters, see NPR 1800.1, NASA Occupational Health Program
Procedures, Center-specific Radiation Protection Program requirements and procedures, and
relevant documents from the licensing or authorizing agency.
e. This directive does not serve to meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance,
does not serve to govern the level of NEPA analysis required for a mission, and does not serve to
govern if there is sufficient safety data to make NEPA determinations. For additional information on
NEPA matters, see NPR 8580.1, Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act and
Executive Order 12114.
f. In this directive, all mandatory actions (i.e., requirements) are denoted by statements containing
the term “shall.” The term “may” denotes a discretionary privilege or permission, “can” denotes
statements of possibility or capability, “should” denotes a good practice and is recommended, but
not required, “will” denotes expected outcome, and “are/is” denotes descriptive material.
g. Where conflicts exist between provisions of this directive and Federal statutes or regulations (e.g.,
provisions of the Atomic Energy Act), or higher-level NASA directives, those statutes, regulations,
and higher-level NASA directives take precedence.
h. In this directive, all document citations are assumed to be the latest version unless otherwise
noted. Use of more recent versions of cited documents may be authorized by the responsible SMA
Technical Authority (TA).
i. Some documents listed as an authority document or reference are called out as either a reference
or authority in the citations found within the text.

Chapter 1. Overview
1.1 Introduction
1.1.1 This directive implements Federal requirements under NSPM-20, “Presidential Memorandum
on Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019. NSPM-20
updates the Federal process for the launch of SNS to “ensure a rigorous, risk informed safety
analysis and launch authorization process.” This directive also incorporates NASA’s responsibilities
under the authorities of other agencies involved in the launch of SNS or radioactive material, the
National Response Framework, and the U.S.’s international commitments.
1.1.2 Procedures and levels of review and analysis required for nuclear launch and reentry
authorization or concurrence vary with the quantity and form of material planned for use, as well as
with the potential radiological risk (e.g., human health exposures, impacts on land use, or impacts on
property use). In the context of this document, reentry or planned return to Earth refers to intended
portions of the spaceflight and is addressed in the authorization or concurrence process. By contrast,
unplanned reentry (referring to an unintended event) is addressed in the safety analysis and RCP
processes.
1.2 Delegation of Responsibilities
1.2.1 Unless specifically prohibited, responsibilities and requirements may be delegated. The stated
role or actor remains accountable for its implementation and outcome.
1.2.2 Where an office or organization is stated as the actor of a requirement, the Official in Charge
of that office or organization is responsible and accountable for the action and its outcome.
1.3 General Terms
Definitions for general terms, such as “A2 mission multiple” and “space nuclear system” are
provided in Appendix A.
1.4 Request for Relief
1.4.1 For additional information on the defined process for requesting and granting relief from
requirements within this directive and standards incorporated by reference herein, see NPR 8715.3.
The Chief, SMA is the Approving Authority for requests for relief to the requirements in this
directive.
1.4.2 For NASA missions, non-conformances with Federal nuclear launch authorization direction in
NSPM-20 or other applicable regulatory-agency requirements will be elevated to the Administrator.
The Administrator, Chief, SMA, and Chief Health and Medical Officer (CHMO) would make such
determinations in consideration of applicable National Space Policy and the responsibilities defined
in NPD 8700.1 with regards to consent to human safety and property risk on behalf of the general
public.
