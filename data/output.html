Preface
P.1 Purpose
a. This directive defines the roles and responsibilities for managing and overseeing NASA’s nuclear
flight safety activities. It provides the requirements to implement NASA’s policy to protect the
public, NASA workforce, high-value equipment and property, and the environment from potential
harm as a result of NASA activities and operations, by factoring safety as an integral feature of
programs, projects, technologies, operations, and facilities.
b. This directive also describes NASA’s implementation of Federal requirements under National
Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM)-20, “Presidential Memorandum on Launch of
Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019, radiological contingency
planning (RCP) as a part of broader NASA emergency management activities (see NPD 8710.1 and
NPR 8715.2) and other factors, as well as agency-specific activities relating to ensuring safety and
mission success for NASA-sponsored payloads containing space nuclear systems (SNS) or other
radioactive material (note that these terms are defined in Appendix A).
c. This directive establishes a framework where other requirements, guidance, and processes (e.g.,
Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear safety and security requirements, U.S. Air and Space Force
range safety requirements, NASA payload safety processes) relevant to nuclear flight safety can be
implemented in to the overall Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) process.
P.2 Applicability
a. This directive is applicable to NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers, including Component
Facilities and Technical and Service Support Centers. This directive applies to the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (a Federally-Funded Research and Development Center), other contractors, recipients of
grants, cooperative agreements, or other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the
applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.
b. This directive is applicable to activities involving flight of SNS or other radioactive material for
which NASA is the sponsoring agency or that involve the use of NASA personnel and assets for
phases of a flight where the SNS or other radioactive material has the potential to affect Earth’s
biosphere. In some cases, aspects of the NASA nuclear flight safety program may fall under the
auspices of another Federal agency, such as in the case of a Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA)-issued license for the launch of NASA-provided radioactive material. If applicability of this
directive is not clear, NASA personnel will consult with the Nuclear Flight Safety Officer (NFSO)
and the Office of the General Counsel to confirm responsibilities for nuclear flight safety.
c. This directive considers nuclear safety and radiological risk from both normal and off-normal
conditions during all phases of flight for which the SNS or other radioactive material has the
potential to affect Earth’s biosphere, typically starting with installation of the SNS or other
radioactive material into an integrated launch vehicle on Earth. Matters outside of this scope are
generally addressed by other NASA disciplines (e.g., planetary protection, crew safety).
d. This directive does not address procedures, requirements, or licensing details for using, storing,

shipping, or handling radioactive materials in ground processing facilities or activities, nor does it
cover these activities as they relate to preparation of the actual radioactive material for space use. For
additional information on these matters, see NPR 1800.1, NASA Occupational Health Program
Procedures, Center-specific Radiation Protection Program requirements and procedures, and
relevant documents from the licensing or authorizing agency.
e. This directive does not serve to meet National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance,
does not serve to govern the level of NEPA analysis required for a mission, and does not serve to
govern if there is sufficient safety data to make NEPA determinations. For additional information on
NEPA matters, see NPR 8580.1, Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act and
Executive Order 12114.
f. In this directive, all mandatory actions (i.e., requirements) are denoted by statements containing
the term “shall.” The term “may” denotes a discretionary privilege or permission, “can” denotes
statements of possibility or capability, “should” denotes a good practice and is recommended, but
not required, “will” denotes expected outcome, and “are/is” denotes descriptive material.
g. Where conflicts exist between provisions of this directive and Federal statutes or regulations (e.g.,
provisions of the Atomic Energy Act), or higher-level NASA directives, those statutes, regulations,
and higher-level NASA directives take precedence.
h. In this directive, all document citations are assumed to be the latest version unless otherwise
noted. Use of more recent versions of cited documents may be authorized by the responsible SMA
Technical Authority (TA).
i. Some documents listed as an authority document or reference are called out as either a reference
or authority in the citations found within the text.

Chapter 1. Overview
1.1 Introduction
1.1.1 This directive implements Federal requirements under NSPM-20, “Presidential Memorandum
on Launch of Spacecraft Containing Space Nuclear Systems,” dated August 20, 2019. NSPM-20
updates the Federal process for the launch of SNS to “ensure a rigorous, risk informed safety
analysis and launch authorization process.” This directive also incorporates NASA’s responsibilities
under the authorities of other agencies involved in the launch of SNS or radioactive material, the
National Response Framework, and the U.S.’s international commitments.
1.1.2 Procedures and levels of review and analysis required for nuclear launch and reentry
authorization or concurrence vary with the quantity and form of material planned for use, as well as
with the potential radiological risk (e.g., human health exposures, impacts on land use, or impacts on
property use). In the context of this document, reentry or planned return to Earth refers to intended
portions of the spaceflight and is addressed in the authorization or concurrence process. By contrast,
unplanned reentry (referring to an unintended event) is addressed in the safety analysis and RCP
processes.
1.2 Delegation of Responsibilities
1.2.1 Unless specifically prohibited, responsibilities and requirements may be delegated. The stated
role or actor remains accountable for its implementation and outcome.
1.2.2 Where an office or organization is stated as the actor of a requirement, the Official in Charge
of that office or organization is responsible and accountable for the action and its outcome.
1.3 General Terms
Definitions for general terms, such as “A2 mission multiple” and “space nuclear system” are
provided in Appendix A.
1.4 Request for Relief
1.4.1 For additional information on the defined process for requesting and granting relief from
requirements within this directive and standards incorporated by reference herein, see NPR 8715.3.
The Chief, SMA is the Approving Authority for requests for relief to the requirements in this
directive.
1.4.2 For NASA missions, non-conformances with Federal nuclear launch authorization direction in
NSPM-20 or other applicable regulatory-agency requirements will be elevated to the Administrator.
The Administrator, Chief, SMA, and Chief Health and Medical Officer (CHMO) would make such
determinations in consideration of applicable National Space Policy and the responsibilities defined
in NPD 8700.1 with regards to consent to human safety and property risk on behalf of the general
public.

matters related to risk, safety, and mission success and serves as the lead SMA TA. To provide
independent oversight of programs and projects in support of safety and mission success, the Chief,
SMA, is responsible for:
a. Appointing a technically-qualified NASA representative to the INSRB. Whenever possible, the
NFSO should not serve as the INSRB member performing the review or administrative support for a
NASA-sponsored mission because the INSRB and the NFSO have different roles and
responsibilities, as well as different degrees of access to mission-specific information. If having
separate individuals fill these roles isn’t possible, the Chief, SMA would ensure appropriate controls
and mitigating measures are in place (e.g., through a memorandum of agreement with the mission).
b. Assisting other authorities in the review and evaluation of radiological risk, including
coordinating with the CHMO regarding decisions involving risk acceptance.
c. Concurring on launch or reentry for missions, as described in Chapter 4 of this directive.
2.8.2 The Chief, SMA designates the NFSO to support these responsibilities and oversee nuclear
flight safety and related nuclear and radiological matters in consultation with the MDAAs.
2.9 Nuclear Flight Safety Officer

a. Engaging TAs, Mission Directorates, and Programs and Projects involving the launch or reentry
of SNS or other radioactive materials on compliance with this directive.
b. Providing administrative support to the INSRB in its standing capacity.
c. Ensuring NASA meets its reporting responsibilities in NSPM-20.
d. Concurring on radiological contingency plans for flights requiring RCP.
e. Concurring on Earth launches or reentries for missions as described by Chapter 4 of this directive,
and performing assessments, when applicable, consistent with Chapter 4 of this directive.
f. Coordinating with organizations that have important interfaces with the nuclear flight safety
program, such as Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer’s (OCHMO’s) ionizing radiation
protection program and the Office of the Chief Engineer’s program and project management
requirements.
2.10 NASA INSRB Representative
2.10.1 The NASA INSRB representative is responsible for:
a. Participating in all relevant INSRB activities.

including costs, between NASA and the agency requesting INSRB review, per NSPM-20.
d. Facilitating early INSRB engagement in the safety analysis process (after the conceptual design of
the mission is generated) for NASA-sponsored Tier II and Tier III missions, as directed by
NSPM-20, in order to identify gaps in time for mission planners to address them without creating
unnecessary delays in the launch timeline.
2.11 Chief Health and Medical Officer
2.11.1 The CHMO advises the Administrator, the Chief, SMA, and the applicable Mission
Directorate(s) of potential health effects related to activities involving flight of nuclear or radioactive
material and participates in NASA and Federal RCP and operational activities, including providing
subject matter expertise in the case of any clean-up efforts. NASA roles, responsibilities, and
procedural requirements for protecting the public and workforce from risks associated with the
handling, use, and storage of radioactive material and radiation generating equipment while not in
flight are documented in NPR 1800.1.

Chapter 3. Mission Categorization for the
Purposes of Nuclear Flight Safety
3.1 Space Nuclear System Tiering
3.1.1 For all missions that include an SNS, the MDAA shall notify the NFSO before System
Definition Review (SDR)/Mission Definition Review (MDR) of the forthcoming launch or reentry
request to support planning of nuclear safety analysis and review activities, as outlined in Chapter 4.
.
3.1.2 For missions involving SNS, the MDAA shall determine the mission’s tier (with an associated
technical basis) and obtain Chief, SMA concurrence to inform the graded approach outlined in
Chapter 4 of this directive and to ensure conformance with NSPM-20. Appendix C provides
information on NSPM-20 tiers. The NFSO will evaluate each tier determination to inform the Chief,
SMA’s concurrence.
3.1.3 For the aspects of mission tiering based on the quantity of material-at-risk, the MDAA (to be
the MDAA with flight responsibilities if multiple MDAAs are contributing SNS or other radioactive
material) should use the highest A2 mission multiple based on the quantity of radioactive materials
expected:
a. During pre-launch activities.
b. At launch.
c. Anytime the spacecraft will be in Earth orbit.
d. During any planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by).
3.1.4 The MDAA shall make a tier determination at up to 3 stages, as follows (the reasoning for
multiple tiering determinations is discussed in Appendix C):
a. Preliminary Tier Determination (PTD) – This determination is made immediately preceding Key
Decision Point C, as that life-cycle gate is defined in NPR 7120.5. This tiering determination will be
made predominantly on the material-at-risk (A2 mission multiple – see Appendix D) and nuclear
fuel-type provisions (for fission reactor systems) contained in NSPM 20. Information related to the
potential radiation exposure levels and associated likelihoods from the safety analyses of relevant
past missions will also be considered. This determination serves to provide initial alignment and
clarity on whether a mission Safety Analysis Report (SAR) is required, whether the INSRB needs to
be engaged, and who the likely authorizing official will be. This determination also serves to lock in
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)-issued A2 values applicable to the mission, given
that these values are periodically updated. If the PTD concludes that a mission is not likely to meet
Tier I, II, or III criteria, this marks the end of the tiering determination process (and all subsequent
nuclear flight safety processes described in this directive will be governed solely by the A2 mission
multiple).
b. Provisional Final Tier Determination (PFTD) [Only applicable if PTD = Tier I, II, or III] – This
determination is made at the approximate mid-point between initial mission SAR release and final

the NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) Library to verify that
this is the correct version before use: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov.</p><p>NPR 8715.26 -- Chapter3 Page 14 of 35
mission SAR delivery, using the postulated accident exposure levels and associated likelihoods
available at that time. This determination serves to ensure earlier recognition of situations where the
authorizing official may change with the final mission SAR (either a higher or lower level of
authorization required), or where the degree of INSRB involvement (or lack thereof) requires
adjustment (i.e., Tier I vs. Tier II).
c. Final Tier Determination (FTD) [Only applicable if PTD = Tier I, II, or III] – This determination
is made upon issuance of the mission SAR (Tier I), or the SER (Tier II or III). This final tier
determination will codify the level of authorization required for the mission and set the stage for
seeking that authorization. This determination serves to establish a final and transparent basis for
establishment of the authorizing official.
3.2 Categorization for Other Missions with Radioactive Material
3.2.1 For all missions that involve radioactive material, but do not include an SNS, the MDAA, in
consultation with the cognizant Center Radiation Safety Officer(s), shall use total mission
radioactive material inventory contained on the launch vehicle to calculate the A2 mission multiple
value per Appendix D.
3.2.2 For all missions that involve radioactive material but do not include an SNS, and for which the
A2 mission multiple is determined to be greater than 1, the MDAA shall notify the NFSO before
SDR/MDR of the forthcoming launch or reentry request to support planning of nuclear safety
analysis and review activities, which are outlined in Chapter 4.
3.3 Other Foreseen Circumstances
NASA personnel shall consult with the NFSO and the NASA Office of the General Counsel to
determine what provisions, if any, of this directive apply when NASA participates in the launch or
reentry of a vehicle or spacecraft from other countries or territories, or in connection with
commercial entities, if the applicability of the provisions in this directive are not sufficiently clear.

Chapter 4. Nuclear Flight Safety Requirements
4.1 Overview of Requirement Characterization
The level of rigor required for nuclear safety analysis and review, the level of authority required to authorize
launch or reentry, the degree of interagency coordination warranted, the degree of RCP needed, and several
other relevant characteristics are all a function of the mission categorization described in the previous
chapter. This formulation provides a graded and risk-informed approach to supporting the decision-making
process. Table 1 provides a mapping of the various required characteristics for each of the differing possible
tiers and categories. This chapter provides the actual requirements associated with each unique element.
Appendix E provides a notional process flow for nuclear flight safety-related activities.
4.2 Nuclear Safety Analysis
4.2.1 The following requirements apply to the development of a nuclear safety analysis via either a mission
SAR or a Safety Analysis Summary (SAS), in accordance with Table 1. As discussed in the associated
definitions in Appendix A, the distinction between these two documents is the degree of rigor and
quantification. Additional contextual information is also provided in Appendix C.
4.2.1.1 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall compile the inputs required by the safety analysis
preparer (e.g., information about the launch vehicle and launch operations) in a timely manner to support
safety analysis preparation, as well as ensuring any needed revisions are addressed as the mission progresses.
4.2.1.2 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall arrange for the preparation of the nuclear safety
analysis (SAS or mission SAR) by the safety analysis preparer.
4.2.1.3 The NASA Program or Project Manager should ensure sufficient coordination between the NFSO,
the INSRB (when applicable), the program, the launch vehicle inputs provider, and the safety analysis
preparer, including agreement to a schedule (typically to be developed prior to Key Decision Point C or its
equivalent) for the delivery of a mission SAR using a phased approach, with the complete final mission SAR
being delivered in accordance with the timeline listed in Table 1. Information potentially useful in the
generation of this schedule is provided in Appendix C and Appendix E.

4.2.1.4 In all cases in which a comparative analysis is being utilized (e.g., a system-specific SAR), the NASA
Program or Project Manager shall obtain from the safety analysis preparer and any separate entity
responsible for launch vehicle inputs, an assessment of the gaps and evaluation findings identified during the
prior analyses (and its reviews) relative to improvements in the state-of-knowledge in the intervening time,
prior to adopting a comparative analysis approach. Additional information is provided in Appendix C.
4.3 Nuclear Safety Review
4.3.1 The following requirements apply to Tier II and Tier III missions, which for NASA-sponsored
missions require an INSRB review and SER, in accordance with NSPM-20:
4.3.1.1 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall engage the INSRB early in the safety analysis process,
typically to occur prior to Key Decision Point C and after the conceptual design of the mission is generated,
in accordance with NSPM-20’s requirement for INSRB engagement early in the safety analysis process.
4.3.1.2 The NASA Program or Project Manager, with concurrence by the INSRB, the Chief, SMA, and the
cognizant MDAA, shall document the terms of the INSRB review, including any estimated costs of the
review. Given NSPM-20 requires the terms and costs of such a review to be agreed to by the NASA
Administrator and the head of the agency requesting the review, for NASA internal missions the terms and
any costs of the INSRB review need the concurrence of the Chief, SMA and the applicable MDAA.
4.3.1.3 The NASA INSRB representative may, as the designated interface between the INSRB and the
NASA mission, provide recommendations to the NASA Program or Project Manager on areas for additional
analysis when gaps are identified, and do so in a timeframe that allows mission planners to address them
without creating unnecessary delays in the launch timeline, in accordance with NSPM-20.
4.3.1.4 The NASA INSRB representative shall, as the designated interface between the INSRB and the
NASA mission, ensure that any omissions or gaps identified by the INSRB during review of a NASA
mission, along with any recommendations for corrective actions, are provided to the NASA Administrator
(or their designee) prior to completion of the mission SAR, in accordance with NSPM-20.
4.3.1.5 The NASA INSRB representative shall, in coordination with the INSRB, ensure that the SER is
ready in the timeframe identified in Table 1, and that a publicly-available Executive Summary is produced.
4.3.2 The following requirements apply to Tier I missions and other (non-tiered) missions with radioactive
material requiring a nuclear safety review as specified in Table 1; in these cases the nuclear safety review
takes the form of an RSR (described in Appendix A).
4.3.2.1 The NFSO shall perform a Radiological Safety Review (RSR), to include a publicly-available
Executive Summary, in accordance with the timeframe identified in Table 1. Appendix A describes the
general form of the RSR.
4.3.2.2 For Tier I missions only, the NASA Program or Project Manager, in coordination with the NFSO,
shall ensure that significant gaps in the safety analysis are identified and provided to the safety analysis
preparer, prior to mission SAR completion.
4.4 Launch and Reentry Authorization or Concurrence
Note: The requirements below are intended to work in tandem with the nuclear flight-specific payload
and range safety requirements for the launch and reentry of SNS or other radioactive materials
contained in NPR 8715.5, NPR 8715.7, NASA-STD-8719.24 and NASA STD-8719.25.
4.4.1 The MDAA should request Agency Views (this is the historically-used term, and is defined in
This document does not bind the public, except as authorized by law or as
NPR 8715.26 -- Chapter4 incorporated into a contract. This document is uncontrolled when printed. Check Page 17 of 35
the NASA Online Directives Information System (NODIS) Library to verify that
this is the correct version before use: https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov.</p><p>NPR 8715.26 -- Chapter4 Page 18 of 35
Appendix A) from the other 6 INSRB-participating agencies for SNS missions in Tiers II or Tier III, if any
of the following conditions exist: (i) the SER concludes that the nuclear safety analysis is of insufficient
quality to support decision making, (ii) the INSRB has been unable to reach unanimity on the SER contents
and a formal dissent by an INSRB member is being attached to the SER, or (iii) an agency represented on the
INSRB has specifically requested the opportunity to provide an Agency View. The MDAA can always
request Agency Views of their own volition. In all other cases, the mission SAR and SER would be
transmitted to the Head of the INSRB agencies (or their designee) as a courtesy, in parallel to proceeding
with the launch authorization request.
4.4.2 Launch and reentry authorization or concurrence (as applicable) is obtained in accordance with the
authorities and timelines indicated in Table 1, and outlined as follows:
4.4.2.1 For SNS in Tier III, the Administrator shall request and obtain the President’s authorization through
the Director of the OSTP. Per NSPM 20, the Director of OSTP may authorize such launches, unless the
Director of OSTP considers it advisable to forward the matter to the President for a decision. To support the
Administrator’s request, a briefing by the applicable MDAA, the nuclear safety analysis preparer, and the
INSRB on the mission SAR, the SER, and the radiological contingency plans will be provided to the
Administrator. If a Tier III mission included a planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), that would be part
of the mission profile addressed by the mission SAR, and thus covered by the launch authorization.
4.4.2.2 For SNS in Tier II, the MDAA shall request and obtain authorization from the NASA Administrator.
The authorization request will include a briefing by the applicable MDAA, the nuclear safety analysis
preparer, and the INSRB on the mission SAR, the SER, and the radiological contingency plans. If a Tier II
mission included a planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), that would be part of the mission profile
addressed by the mission SAR, and thus covered by the launch authorization.
4.4.2.3 For SNS in Tier I, the MDAA shall request and obtain authorization from the NASA Administrator.
The authorization request will include a summary of the major findings from the mission SAR and the RSR,
as well as information regarding the radiological contingency plans. If a Tier I mission included a planned
return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), that would be part of the mission profile addressed by the mission SAR,
and thus covered by the launch authorization.
4.4.2.4 For missions involving radioactive material, but not including an SNS, the MDAA, in consultation
with the cognizant Center Radiation Safety Officer(s), shall request concurrence from the NFSO or Chief,
SMA (in accordance with Table 1), except where an Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)-issued
categorical relief memo is being applied (in which case only a notification is required). This concurrence
request needs to account for radioactive material integrated into the spacecraft as part of mission design, as
well as radioactive material that may be included in the launch or reentry (e.g., cargo). When the mission
involves planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by), this will be included in the launch concurrence request
and will be covered by the launch concurrence. Appendix F provides a suggested format for the radioactive
material reporting portion of the request.
4.4.2.5 For any planned return to Earth (reentry or fly-by) of radioactive material not covered by a launch
concurrence (such as return from an orbiting research platform) the NASA Program or Project Manager shall
request reentry concurrence in accordance with the analysis, review, and timelines identified in Table 1,
except when an OSMA-issued categorical relief memo is being applied (in which case only a notification is
required).
4.5 Contingency Planning and Coordination
4.5.1 For missions designated to require RCP in Table 1, the MDAA as the lead programmatic authority and
the Center Director affiliated with the applicable range as the lead institutional authority, in coordination
with the Chief, SMA and the NFSO, shall negotiate and implement a process to assure the safety of the
public and NASA workforce in the event of a mishap that may create radiological risk, in cooperation with

public and NASA workforce in the event of a mishap that may create radiological risk, in cooperation with
OCHMO, OIIR, OPS, the preparer of the nuclear safety analysis used for launch approval, relevant U.S.
government agencies (including explicit Authorities and established Agreements therein, such as ones with
the DOE), relevant local and State authorities, and international partners.
4.5.2 In developing the process to assure safety in the event of a mishap that may create radiological risk, the
MDAA and Center Director should address:
a. Definition of an appropriate radiological contingency planning risk posture, comparative or otherwise, to
inform decisions regarding radiological safety.
b. Development, reporting, independent review, and acceptance by relevant authorities of an assurance case
tailored to the defined radiological contingency planning risk posture substantiating sufficient radiological
material control and mishap preparedness, including the information necessary to make informed and
reliable decisions regarding:
(1) Invoking contingency plans (with such plans being developed) to control where the radiological material
will impact when vehicle or spacecraft control is possible;
(2) Monitoring, assessment, analysis, and communications capabilities sufficient to determine whether a
release of radioactive material has occurred, characterize the location and nature of the release, and develop
protective action recommendations for the safety of personnel and the public;
(3) Invoking material recovery plans (with such plans being developed);
(4) Disseminating information about the mishap and any recommended protective actions at the local and
State levels;
(5) Coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security’s FEMA to support Federal-level coordination,
and meeting the expectations of the National Response Framework and the Nuclear/Radiological Incident
Annex to the Response and Recovery Federal Interagency Operational Plans (including NASA’s role as
Primary Authority, when applicable);
(6) Working in concert with nuclear and other flight safety authorities or licensing entities to ensure
additional relevant requirements therein are being met;
(7) Preparing, obtaining approval of, and issuing communications to the general public and to international
partners, via the appropriate communications channels;
c. Implementation and exercising of the above process, plans, and capabilities, and integration of the above
process within the mission-wide mishap preparedness and contingency planning (MPCP) process, which is
developed in accordance with NPR 8621.1.
4.5.3 For missions that fall in to NSPM-20 Tier I, II, or III, and for other missions with an A2 mission
multiple greater than 1, the NASA Program or Project Manager should consult with the Office of the
General Counsel to determine if any additional actions need to be taken with respect to alignment on relevant
nuclear/radiological-specific insurance and indemnification provisions. Missions other than those described
above, would generally not warrant this step.
4.6 Life-Cycle Activities Relevant After Launch Authorization
4.6.1 General (Tier I, II, and III missions only)
4.6.1.1 The NASA Program or Project Manager shall incorporate nuclear flight safety considerations starting
with program or project formulation through the point at which the SNS or other radioactive material no
longer has the potential to affect Earth’s biosphere. Examples of the types of considerations that apply

include: factoring radiological risk in to the launch vehicle selection process, managing radiation exposure to
equipment, managing access to the spacecraft and the SNS, managing SNS maintenance, managing SNS
control (when applicable), managing criticality safety, managing SNS malfunctions, biasing aimpoints for
Earth gravity assist trajectories, and managing operational procedures and training.
4.6.1.2 The NASA Program or Project Manager, in coordination with the CHMO and the Mission
Directorate with human rating responsibilities, shall address radiation exposures from the SNS into mission
planning and execution for missions involving crews, or for missions where the SNS is anticipated to come
into proximity with crew from other missions.
4.6.2 Lead-up-to-Launch and Post-Launch Operation (Tier I, II, and III missions only)
4.6.2.1 The NFSO should ensure that the results of the nuclear safety analysis and nuclear safety review are
factored into SMA oversight after launch authorization, including consideration of the safety guidelines in
NSPM-20. Appendix C presents two alternative approaches to accomplishing this best practice.
4.6.3 Decommissioning and Disposal of SNS (Tier I, II, and III missions only)
4.6.3.1 For SNS-enabled missions designed to operate in low Earth orbit, the NASA Program or Project
Manager shall demonstrate by analysis that the mission design enables for disposal of the SNS in a
sufficiently high orbit (as defined in Space Policy Directive-6), including the incorporation of a highly
reliable operational system to ensure effective and controlled disposition of the reactor.
Note: Considerations for fission reactor systems are discussed in Section 3(a)(iii) of Space Policy
Directive-6, dated December 16, 2020. All activities related to safe storage and orbital decay should
involve the Orbital Debris Program Office.
4.7 Internal and External Reporting
4.7.1 The NFSO shall transmit a copy of gap identification documents, the mission SAR or SAS, the SER or
RSR, and launch and reentry authorizations or concurrences, as applicable, to the NASA Headquarters
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Manager and the CHMO.
4.7.2 On an annual basis, the NFSO shall provide a report to the Chief, SMA for transmittal to the Director
of OSTP listing all launches that the agency has sponsored in the past calendar year of spacecraft using
radioactive sources containing total quantities in the range of 1,000 times to 100,000 times the A2 value (i.e.,
the mission multiple calculated in Chapter 3), and listing all such launches planned for the coming calendar
year.
4.7.3 The NFSO shall execute an annual briefing by NASA staff (and relevant interagency stakeholders) to
OSTP and the National Science and Technology Council on the status of safety analysis for all planned
NASA-sponsored Tier II or Tier III missions that will involve the launch of an SNS.

Appendix A. Definitions
A2 value. These values are listed in Table 2 of the IAEA's Specific Safety Requirements No.
SSR–6, Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (Source:
https://nucleus-apps.iaea.org/nss-oui/collections/publishedcollections); the current version is the
2018 Edition; “A2 will mean the activity value of radioactive material, other than special form
radioactive material, that is listed in Table 2 or derived in Section IV and is used to determine the
activity limits for the requirements of these Regulations.”
A2 mission multiple. A measure of the amount of radioactive “material at-risk,” relative to an
IAEA standard used for land, sea, and air transport.
Agency views. This refers to a formal process of transmitting the mission SAR and SER to the Head
of an INSRB-participating organization and requesting any feedback that the Agency Head wishes
to be integrated into the launch authorization decision.
Categorical relief. A memorandum co-issued by the Chief, SMA and CHMO, which outlines
conditions where OSMA nuclear flight safety concurrence is not required owing to the small degree
of radiological risk of the mission relative to the assurance provided through NASA’s routine
oversight of the handling of radioactive materials, and separately, of payload and range safety
activities. When a launch or reentry meets these prescribed conditions, a waiver is not required for
any requirements in this directive that specifically states inapplicability upon the invocation of
categorical relief (a.k.a., a blanket concurrence).
Launch activities. The launch phase begins when the spacecraft transfers to internal power and ends
when the spacecraft achieves an operational configuration after separation from the launch vehicle.
Member of the public. This term is defined on an analysis-specific basis as follows: (i) primary
consideration should be given to the distinction between public and non-public as it is codified for
the applicable range; (ii) barring this, the codified policy of the applicable nuclear safety authority
(DOE or Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)) will be used.
Nuclear safety. Application of safety policies, principles, and techniques to ensure the control and
containment of radioactive material to minimize adverse impacts from accidents that could endanger
life or cause property damage. Assessing and managing radiological risk is an important component
of nuclear safety; however, nuclear safety also encompasses aspects (e.g., RCP, modeling
uncertainty) that may not be explicitly modeled in the radiological risk assessment.
Pre-launch activities. Defined to start at the earliest stage of launch vehicle integrated operations
where a hazard (e.g., crane failure, fire) would exist for credible accidents to cause the uncontrolled
release of radioactivity.
Radioactive material. In the context of this document, this refers specifically to radioisotopes
contained in a payload that undergo radioactive decay, and in so doing produces alpha particles, beta
particles, gamma rays, x-rays, neutrons, high-speed electrons, high-speed protons, or other particles
capable of producing ions (i.e., ionizing radiation). The term is used differently than space nuclear
systems, to denote material that typically has smaller quantities of radioisotopes and are typically in
a form without engineered safety features.
Radiological Control Center (RADCC). The RADCC is an onsite operational control center at

Kennedy Space Center staffed by NASA, DOE, Range personnel, and other Federal, State, and local
emergency management organizations to manage data collection and assessment (typically called
the Data Assessment Center, or DAC), provide management decisions for radiological matters
(typically called the Primary Authority Representative Management Group, or PMG) and oversee
public information and messaging (typically called the Joint Information Center, or JIC).
Radiological risk. In the context of this directive, this term refers to the application of risk concepts
(see Risk) to assess the potential impacts of postulated accident scenarios that result in release of
radiological material. This assessment typically analyzes some combination of human health
exposures (via applicable exposure pathways), impacts on land use, and impacts on property use.
These differing impacts are often inter-related (e.g., land interdiction assumptions may balance
impacts on land use against the dose received through specific exposure pathways). The scope of
impacts considered is typically proportional to the radiological risk.
Radiological Safety Review (RSR). A review of a planned launch or return to Earth (fly-by or
reentry) of radioactive material (sometimes evaluating a nuclear safety analysis and sometimes
serving as a stand-alone nuclear flight safety review) that qualitatively or semi-quantitatively
addresses the radiological risk of the mission, by describing the form and quantity of radioactive
material being launched or reentered, describing the relevant mission profile, providing an analysis
of the probabilities of launch and in-flight accidents which could result in the terrestrial release of
radioactive materials (surface and air), providing a realistic and a pessimistically-biased estimate of
the health and other effects due to a radioactive material release in the considered accident scenarios,
and providing mission-specific information that would be relevant for contingency planning and
material recovery. The scope and depth of the RSR would be tailored and scaled to the risk, and
would be less intensive than the effort needed to develop a SER.
Range safety. Application of safety policies, principles, and techniques to protect the public, NASA
workforce, and/or property from hazards associated with range flight operations. Additionally, the
term “Range Safety” is informally used to refer to the organization responsible for
implementing/enforcing range safety requirements.
Risk. The consideration of (a) scenarios leading to undesired outcomes, (b) the likelihood of these
scenarios, and (c) the consequences, impact, or severity of the impact that would result if those
scenarios were to occur. Within a probabilistic risk assessment framework, a primary representation
of risk is the product of the likelihood of occurrence and the associated consequence, aggregated
across all modeled scenarios. A separate representation of risk involves the tabulation of the
probability of exceeding a given consequence at a specified value (or range of values) using a
complementary cumulative distribution function. In both uses, uncertainty is customarily treated.
Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The study of credible potential releases of radioactive material into
the biosphere, often founded in a probabilistic risk assessment that: (a) uses launch vehicle accident
probabilities and accident environment data as inputs to analysis tools that estimate the probabilities
and magnitudes of postulated radiological releases, (b) predicts transport through and deposition in
the environment, (c) estimates accident impacts, and (d) evaluates the variability and uncertainty of
the estimates, including gaps in knowledge (i.e., missing or incomplete information) that could
impact the calculated estimates. Such a study may be system-specific (i.e., a system specific SAR)
or within the context of a mission (i.e., a mission SAR), As described in NSPM-20, a
system-specific SAR establishes a safety basis (a set of conditions under which safety analysis and
hazard controls provide assurance of safe operation). To leverage this system-specific SAR, the
mission SAR must either (i) demonstrate that the mission is within the safety basis envelope or (ii)

include supplemental safety analysis for any deviations that are outside of the established safety
basis envelope.
Safety Analysis Summary (SAS). Relative to a SAR, a SAS is typically not a probabilistic risk
assessment, but rather a quantitative screening analysis resulting in a conservatively-biased
assessment of the radiological risk of launching or reentering smaller sources. The SAS provides a
description of the radioactive materials, their physical state/chemical form, quantities involved,
mission profile information, the probabilities of potential launch vehicle and spacecraft failures, the
resulting accident impacts, and a characterization of the associated radiological risk. The level of
detail (including the degree of realism sought through validation of the physical models used)
should be commensurate with the anticipated radiological risk based upon relevant past radiological
analyses.
Safety Evaluation Report (SER). The product of an INSRB review which documents the INSRB’s
findings to the head of the sponsoring agency or the Secretary of Transportation in order to inform
the decision to proceed with launch and, for Tier III missions, inform any decision to request
Presidential launch authorization.
Space Nuclear System (SNS). This term is used here to include devices using radioactive or
fissioning material, typically with engineered safety features relevant to launch and flight. It includes

Tiers. The terms Tier I, Tier II, and Tier III relate to very specific criteria that are described in
NSPM-20 and discussed further in Appendix C here. In the present document, an un-tiered mission
is one that does not meet the criteria of Tier I, II, or III and relates to the flight of radioactive
material other than a space nuclear system.

Appendix C. Additional Information Regarding
NSPM-20 and Nuclear Flight Safety
C.1 The following additional information is provided pertaining to NSPM-20, relative to the requirements
contained in Chapter 3. . This is clarifying information and does not contain any additional requirements.
C.1.1 NSPM-20 sets tier boundaries based on material-at-risk, technology, and radiological risk estimates
stemming from the nuclear safety analysis, with the ultimate tier depending on a combination of factors.
Therefore, final determinations are made after completion of the nuclear safety analysis. However, the
characteristics of safety analysis review depend on the tier, and so earlier evaluation of the likely tiering
outcome is also needed. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the NSPM-20 tiering criteria, while Table 2
provides a tabular capturing of the same criteria.
Figure 1: Illustration Showing NSPM-20 Tiering Factors

Report; SER = Safety Evaluation Report; SNS = Space nuclear system)

Tier - Quantity of radioactive material is > 100,000×A2, or
II - Any Tier I launches where the associated safety analyses determine that the
probability of an accident during launch or subsequent operation resulting in an
exposure in the range of 5 rem to 25 rem total effective dose (TED) to any member of
the public is equal to or greater than 1 in 1,000,000, or
- Nuclear fission systems and other devise with a potential for criticality using
low-enriched uranium.
Tier - Any spacecraft containing a space nuclear system for which the associated safety
III analyses determine that the probability of an accident during launch or subsequent
operation resulting in an exposure in excess of 25 rem TED to any member of the public
is equal to or greater than 1 in 1,000,000, or
- Nuclear fission systems and other devices with a potential for criticality where such
systems utilize any nuclear fuel other than low-enriched uranium.
C.1.2 A few features of NSPM-20 implementation within this directive warrant elaboration.
C.1.2.1 NSPM-20 clearly states in Section 1 that it "updates the process for launches of spacecraft
containing space nuclear systems," while later using the terminology "radioactive sources" in the definitions
of Tier I and Tier II. In this directive, NSPM-20 is only applied to SNS (with the expectation that no other
payload would have an A2 mission multiple greater than 1,000), while the nuclear safety analysis would
need to consider any additional radioactive material in the payload (in addition to the SNS). Other
requirements in this directive ensure nuclear flight safety for all other missions.
C.1.2.2 While the term spacecraft is used in both NSPM-20 and this directive, any radioactive material on the
integrated launch vehicle aside from the spacecraft would need to be considered (acknowledging that this
would be atypical for a NASA mission).
C.1.2.3 The lower bound of Tier I is treated to equate to an A2 mission multiple of 1,000. This is effectively
the lower end of historical SNS flown and comports with NSPM-20's reporting requirement bounds codified
in Section 6 of that document.
C.1.2.4 There is a possibility that an SNS (that is not a fission reactor system) with an A2 mission multiple of
less than 1,000 could surpass the NSPM-20 Tier III criterion associated with the probability of an exposure
in excess of 25 rem being greater than 1 in 1 million. The tiering approach taken in this directive only
addresses this possibility to the extent that it can be reasonably foreseen at the Preliminary Tier
Determination stage. Nevertheless, this is not a situation that is anticipated to occur in practice based on
contemporary SNS designs, mission profiles, and radiological risk state-of-knowledge.
C.2 The following additional information is provided pertaining to nuclear flight safety, relative to the
requirements contained in Chapter 4. . This is clarifying information and does not contain any additional
requirements.
C.2.1 The following passages provide contextual information about safety analysis preparation practices.
C.2.1.1 While the details of the SAS or mission SAR schedule will be informed by other guidance, the
mutually agreed upon schedule would typically address: the planned analysis schedule; a technical interface
document between NASA and the safety analysis preparer; base assumptions, analysis limitations/bounds,
and model descriptions associated with the mission SAR or SAS development; and the development of a
draft or initial mission SAR well in advance of (e.g., one year prior to) the final mission SAR. This, and
related information, can be captured in a Safety Design Strategy, Safety Architecture, Safety Case, or
equivalent product.
C.2.1.2 While the details of the SAS or mission SAR will be informed by other guidance, the scope of the

- Any Tier I launches where the associated safety analyses determine that the
probability of an accident during launch or subsequent operation resulting in an
exposure in the range of 5 rem to 25 rem total effective dose (TED) to any member of

SAS or mission SAR activity would typically include pre-launch and launch activities, as well as all
operational phases where the SNS or other radioactive material could result in exposure of a member of the
public in the event of an accident. The consideration of accident impacts would typically be sufficiently
broad to support the nuclear safety review, the nuclear launch or reentry authorization or concurrence
process (comparison to NSPM-20's safety guidelines, the specific items described in Section 5(b) of
NSPM-20, and mission tiering), range safety uses, mishap preparedness and contingency planning activities,
and public risk communications. The mission SAR or SAS would typically utilize a recognized standard or
precedent (NRC or DOE guidance, INSRB guidance, a NASA Technical Standard, a consensus standard) or
an appropriate precedent (e.g., the mission SAR from a contemporary mission with a similar payload),
adjusted as necessary to address the specifics of the SNS context and the mission at-hand, for baselining the
contents of the mission SAR.
C.2.1.3 The level of detail and content of the mission SAR or SAS will be commensurate with the mission
radiological risk. Per NSPM-20, "a mission SAR may incorporate a system-specific SAR that establishes a
safety basis for the space nuclear system," and NSPM-20 goes on to describe this relationship. In cases
where launch vehicles, configurations, mission characteristics, and SNS are similar and it is determined by
the safety analysis and review stakeholders that a comparative analysis will appropriately estimate the
radiological risk of the mission, a comparative analysis can be utilized. Radioisotope heater unit (RHU) and
radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) risk assessments have demonstrated over time that a fairly
mature understanding of mission phase radiological risk contributions exists for these devices, while also
demonstrating shifts in the relative importance of phenomena associated with both changes to
state-of-knowledge (e.g., breach modeling, dispersion modeling) and mission characteristics (e.g., clad
temperature, launch window climatological conditions).
C.2.1.4 Where nuclear or radioactive materials are being provided from multiple sources, MDAAs may
provide a single or multiple safety analysis document(s) to best meet this requirement (e.g., in a case where
an SNS relies heavily on an existing system-specific SAR while other radioactive material requires a
completely new SAS). Depending on the specifics of the circumstances, it may be necessary to justify why
the radiological risks can be treated in an additive fashion when using multiple mission SARs. Some
consequence metrics do not scale linearly with the activity of released material.
C.2.2 Regarding insurance and indemnification in the context of radiological incidents, in general, Federal
funding is made available for resulting damages and response costs in accordance with Federal law through
one or more of the Price-Anderson Act, the Space Act, and the Stafford Act. The final determination of
which of these, or other authorities, would be used to provide Federal funding in the event of a launch or
reentry accident can only be made after-the-fact, based on the specific facts of the actual incident and the
claims in question.
C.2.3 Regarding SMA oversight following launch authorization, two approaches are suggested below for
accomplishing this best practice.
C.2.3.1 Alternative #1 - The NFSO, in coordination with the NASA Program or Project Manager, the
Payload Safety Working Group (PSWG) Chair, the Project-Level SMA TA, and the INSRB (when
applicable) can use the results of the nuclear safety analysis and nuclear safety review to construct a
nuclear-specific and mission-specific critical analysis assumptions list that would be formally issued to the
PSWG Chair and relevant SMA TAs, for use within the routine launch services and mission execution
processes. This list would, in effect, serve as an amendment to the NPR 8719.24 compliance matrix and
would serve to facilitate the monitoring of anticipatable issues, if any are identified, that would cause the
mission to likely exceed (or further exceed by a significant amount) NSPM-20's safety guidelines, or that
would cause a significant degradation of defense-in-depth (e.g., fission product barriers). In this way, the list
serves as a tool to codify nuclear flight safety-specific factors into these stages of NASA's routine risk
management processes.
C.2.3.2 Alternative #2 - Barring adoption of the above, the NFSO could periodically monitor available

information streams and/or consult with the applicable SMA interface for that phase of the mission in order
to identify events and conditions that significantly deviate from the assumptions of the SAR during periods
leading up to launch and subsequent operation (that are within scope of the SAR) for Tier I, II, and III
missions, and which are also prior to the spacecraft entering inter-planetary flight with no plan for return or
Earth gravity assist. In cases where identified events could reasonably be expected to cause the mission
execution to exceed (or further exceed by a significant additional quantity) NSPM-20's safety guidelines or
requirements (e.g., Department of the Air Force risk constraint), the NFSO would perform a simple,
scoping-level qualitative or semi-quantitative assessment of the impact of the event or condition, and
document this assessment in a note to file. In cases where a specific event or condition is found to indeed
exceed (or further exceed by a significant additional quantity) the safety guidelines or a quantitative
requirement, this would be captured in a memo and discussed with the relevant SMA interface, such that it
can be factored in to safety and mission success activities (e.g., a PSWG Safety Review, the Safety and
Mission Success Review (SMSR)).
C.2.3.2.1 Regarding Alternative #2, depending on the circumstances, the appropriate interface might be the
Project-level SMA TA, a Program-affiliated SMA TA, the SMA Launch Services Division Mission Safety
Engineer, the Payload Safety Program Executive, the Range Safety Program Executive, or the PSWG Chair.
In some cases, the monitoring of information sources (e.g., the Launch Services Portal where the PSWG
posts spacecraft non-compliances after the Payload Safety Compliance has been signed) may be a suitable
replacement to contacting the interface.
C.2.3.2.2 Also regarding Alternative #2, the appropriate periodicity of monitoring the mission will vary
greatly depending on the phase of the mission execution (e.g., more frequently during the period following
SNS integration into the integrated launch vehicle and prior to launch versus less frequently during
spaceflight). Examples of events and conditions that would be relevant are: (a) a two-fold increase in the time
window in which the SNS is being cooled by ground support equipment relative to that assumed in the SAR,
(b) a significant deficiency identified in the performance of a safety-relief valve that cannot be mitigated and
effectively results in an increase in launch vehicle unreliability, and (c) a spacecraft malfunction while in
Earth orbit that significantly increases the likelihood of not being in a sufficiently high orbit when the
mission reaches end-of-life.

Appendix D. Calculation of the A2 Mission
Multiple
D.1 Determination of A2 Mission Multiple
D.1.1 The instructions below relate to the use of IAEA guidance as it pertains to nuclear flight
safety, consistent with the use of this same guidance in NSPM-20 and preceding Presidential
direction. This guidance is used as a matter of convenience, understanding that the guidance was not
developed specifically for use in launch or reentry. Its invocation here may differ from other NASA
uses of this guidance, as they pertain to transportation of radioactive material by land, sea, or air
under the authorization or licensing by other Federal agencies.
D.1.2 The latest available version of IAEA SSR-6 should be used. Note: IAEA SSR-6 provides
values in terabecquerels (TBq), while NASA sources are often catalogued in curies (Ci), so care
should be taken when calculating the mission multiple (1 TBq = approx. 27 Ci).
D.1.3 While the table provided in IAEA SSR-6 (Table 2 in the case of the 2018 Update) is typically
sufficient for obtaining the necessary A2 multiples, the user should be aware of the caveats and
explanation that appears before and after that table (e.g., Sections 402-407 in the case of the 2018
Update), which are applicable to special circumstances.
D.1.4 The A2 mission multiple will be determined using the equation below, where n represents
each source of radioactive material on the launch vehicle and spacecraft. A simple example is
provided in Table 3.
